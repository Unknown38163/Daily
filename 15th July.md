## Scrum Methodology:

* P.O, S.M, S.T, Designer
* Every person will have a sprint like 2 week, 3 week,
* We will have many meeting conducted within a sprint



Note: In scrum methodology everything is perfectly planned and then executed.



We can implement scrum methodology using JIRA, where all the team members will get the updates that happens throughout the sprint..



In Scrum, before any activity starts, a proper plan will be prepared.



* Suppose sprint 3 is started and there is some issue with product delivered to customer from sprint 1 and sprint 2 then they can't include this issue in the current sprint i.e sprint 3 as planned activities cannot be completed within deadline. Those issue will be addressed in sprint 4.
* For such issues we will use **Kanban Methodology.**
* Scrum Backlog includes user stories
* Kanban Backlog includes all the problems caused to customer.
* Scrum and Kanban goes simultaneously, any bug occurred during scrum is forwarded to Kanban dashboard, in backlog section, any dev that is free will resolve it.
* When no problem don't create Kanban dashboard.



**SCRUMBAN = SCRUM + KANBAN**



scrum(fixed timeline): to-do, in-progress, done

Kanban (flexible) : backlog, to-do, in-progress, done (developer and tester handle it)



## Extreme Programming (XP)

Focuses only on the developer's perspective.

Has some rules, will basically make developer to improve quality of the software



1. **Pair programming**: 2 Developers working together on a software development by connecting to same system. Dev A => Create a feature, Dev B => Enhance the feature example
2. **TDD** **(Test Driven Development)**: Write test program before writing actual code such that it should pass test program.
3. **Continuous Integration:** Always do continuous integration, such that whenever Dev A, Dev B write some code to develop a functionality, if the code is correct, immediately push that code to GitHub.
4. **Small Releases:** Can be shown to customer immediately, On Monday the develop something show it to customer.
5. **Customer will connect with developers everyday.**
6. **Collective Code ownership:** Both are taking responsibility, if any bug reported.
7. **No need to work for extra hours.**



## Agile Testing



The testing that happens in agile model and testing that happen in other models are not same.

In other models testing will start after the development is completely done, while in agile testing happens every time a developer develops a feature.





**Testing is done in agile model in 4 quadrants:**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Testing done by the developers        | Testing done by tester's i.e. Functional Testing           |         

|  (WBT, Unit Testing)                              |                                                                                                  |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Testing done by Customer                  | Testing done by tester's i.e. Non-Functional Testing   | 

|                                                                    |                                                                                                  |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



**What is Sprint 0 or Iteration 0?**

It is a time duration during which the infrastructure setup of the project will happen. 

* Development Environment should be ready
* Test Environment should be ready
* Decide what are the tools that will be used in this sprint Selenium.

Scrum Master, Product Owner, Devop's Engineer, etc. ==> Meeting ==> Setup will be done in 1 week or 2 week.
