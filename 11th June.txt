Security Testing:

Android O.S Problems:- 
1) No security for third-party apps 
2) Delay in software updates
3) Pre-installed applications(Bloatware)

Various ways available to achieved security (Device/App) : 
1) Always download apps from verified sources (playstore, appstore)
2) Give the permission to the app which is controlled by the user.
3) Use some lock mechanism (PIN, Pattern, ...) 
4) Use Antivirus software 
5) Security by Masking data ( hide the data (wifi name = capg_01 => acceptable_01))
6) Encryption : 
Password ==> Bcrypt ( hash()) ==> encrypted data
Salt are random character added to your encrypted data
7) XSS attack( Cross Site Scripting) - It is a attack where the hacker will try to introduce some javascript code through the UI.
We have to sanitize the incoming data( >, <, *, !, - Ignore) => cloudware 
8) SQL Injection: It is a attack where the attacker tries to modify the SQL query to trick the database.
insett into registration(username, password) values ( username, password)
                                                      "1"=="1", "1"=="1"
select * from registration where username = "1" == "1"
